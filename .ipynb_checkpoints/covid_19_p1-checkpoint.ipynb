    "# Background\n",
    "As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, one of the greatest challenges to response efforts is a lack of data and evidence about infection and mortality rates. We will learn more about the virus and the  populations most at risk as more test kits arrive in the hands of physicians and the total number of cases becomes clearer. Ideally, this information will be used to help target response efforts, guide policy decisions, inform the donor community, and support decision-making by businesses and multinational organizations whose work spans multiple countries. As a global development company with staff in over ___ countries, this kind of information is invaluable, as we think about ways to support our staff, and prepare for what comes next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from the earliest confirmed cases of COVID-19 indicates that some groups of people are at a higher risk for infection than others. Public health organizations like the WHO and US CDC have released warnings for those at higher risk to take extra precautionary measures. To help DAI and other global development organizations better understand vulnerabilities in the communities in which they work, the DAI Global Health and the Center for Digital Acceleration are tracking these risk factors, in addition to other potential correlates to mortality rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this first of a multi-part series, we will keep an updated record of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors that are perceived to being correlated with heightened risk of mortality and identify known country and subnational datasets that can help us identify countries at risk. We will also provide charts and maps to identify potential country level “hotspots.” \n"
