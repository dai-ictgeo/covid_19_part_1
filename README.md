# Purpose

As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, one of the greatest challenges to response efforts is a lack of data and evidence about infection and mortality rates. We will learn more about the virus and the populations most at risk as more test kits arrive in the hands of physicians. Ideally, this information will be used to help target response efforts, guide policy decisions, inform the donor community, and support decision-making by organizations whose work spans multiple countries, and may need to sustain long-term relief efforts. As a global development company with projects all over the world, this kind of information is invaluable as we think about ways to support our staff and prepare for what comes next.

Information from the earliest confirmed cases of COVID-19 indicates that some groups of people are at a higher risk for infection than others. Public health organizations like the WHO and US CDC have [released warnings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) for those at higher risk to take extra precautionary measures. To help DAI and other global development organizations better understand vulnerabilities in the communities in which they work, the DAI Global Health and the Center for Digital Acceleration are tracking these risk factors, in addition to other potential correlates to mortality rates.  

# Data

As a team, we are working to gather data on country level factors. That data is currently in a public google spreadsheet.

# Research Roadmap

1.	**Part 1: Demographic, Socio-economic, and Environmental Statistics.** This will focus on demographic descriptive statistics of country level factors that MAY show vulnerable populations based on current hypotheses. For example, we hear that people over the age of 65 are at high risk of mortality. We will take this as truth (until proven otherwise) and use country level data on population distribution to highlight what countries have an older vs. younger population.  

2.	**Part 2: Country Preparedness.** This assessment would look at scores as assessed by the Joint External Evaluations (JEE) and or Nuclear Threat Initiatives (NTI) Global Health Security Index, and highlight country level preparedness vs trends in infection/mortality.   

3.	**Part 3: Risk Index**. This third paper will combine data from the previous two analysis to create a risk index, identifying countries at greatest risk based on all data collected.
